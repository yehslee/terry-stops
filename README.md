This project consists of a breakdown of the biases presented on specifically "ONVIEW" traffic and suspicious stops made by police officers on the spot with data retrieved from https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Terry-Stops/28ny-9ts8/data.
ONVIEW stops are made by solely the police officer on call, based on their personal reasoning. In other words, it gives freedom for officers to stop a car based on the perceptions they believe are true.
The data that is being used is filtered to instances that are were called in as "Suspicious Stop", "Suspicious Person" and "Traffic Stop", all that are typed as ONVIEW.
